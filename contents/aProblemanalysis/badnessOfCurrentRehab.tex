\subsection{Shortcomings of Current Rehabilitation}

It is known that clinical trials and training translates poorly to daily life outside clinical environments, however still current rehabilitation mainly perform training in clinical environments, or train tasks which poorly portrait normal daily life. \cite{Basteris2014}
%Loosing functionality of mobility can lead to several different risks for the patient, one of which is falls. Both 
This is a problem since both stroke and SCI patients experience a greater risk of falls. The prevention of patients falling should be prioritized in rehabilitation as falls can lead to loss of independence and serious injury \cite{Zehr2011}. Despite the consequences, studies have shown that 30-39\% of stroke patients fall at least once during a rehabilitative process, and of these patients 42\% experience multiple falls. \cite{Bhalla2016, Hanger2014} According to a study by Wannapakhe et. al \cite{Wannapakhe2015}, out of a group of 100 SCI patients, 45 experienced falls during a six month period post rehabilitation. %This suggest that current rehabilitation is not properly preparing patients to live safe daily lives.
Apart from the immediate risks and dangers to patients falling, falls can also further extend the rehabilitation period and worsen the rehabilitation of both motor and cognitive functions \cite{Wong2016, Blennerhassett2012}. This is a problem since strength recovery is usually greatest in the first 100 days following injury \cite{Weidner2017}, but continues to improve even years after the stroke incident \cite{Sun2015}. An additional risk for both stroke and SCI patients is cardiovascular events during training, due to a decreased functional capacity following the incidents \cite{Zehr2011}.

In addition, current rehabilitation programs still use qualitative methods for evaluating patients progress. These methods rely on the physician to evaluate how well the patient performs \cite{ANPT_SCI2018, ANPT_Stroke2018}. This is a problem since qualitative evaluations are prone to changes from session to session depending on many factors which are not accounted for, like the patients level of energy or the physicians personal experience. This could be a problem since patients are observed to experience falls post rehabilitation \cite{Bhalla2016, Hanger2014, Wannapakhe2015}. This might suggest that current evaluation methods does not properly evaluate whether or not patients are fit for independent daily life. 




 

%Current ambulatory care does not facilitate high activity levels for patients. A study by Kathleen et al. \cite{Michael2005} have shown patients to have extremely low levels of daily activity (avg. 2837 steps/day) when compared to the norm (5000-6000 steps/day) for sedentary elderly people (65-70 years). Without adequate training and activity patients have little chance of regaining lost mobility, which are as previously described can lead to loss of confidence in performing movements, loss of independence, prolonged rehabilitation period and an increased risk of falls and injury.

%following section describes current inside and outside clinical environment rehab methods, which are already described in cAssessingGait.tex
%Current rehabilitation often involves gait treadmill training for rehabilitating dynamic movements /cite{simons kilde 8}}. However, as often is with training of patients in clinical environments, this approach translates poorly to real life outside the clinical environment \cite{Basteris2014}. In daily life sudden changes in walking speed or change of direction is normal and necessary, however this is often not accounted for on a treadmill in a clinical environment. To improve muscle strength of patients, weights or cables have been used to apply resistance to leg movement when walking on a treadmill, however this approach is cumbersome and cannot be used outside clinical environments. 
%Different methods have been researched to explore ways to both train balance and strength in patients gait. A study by Washabaugh et al. \cite{Washabaugh2016}, developed a device which could be worn outside clinical environments to put resistance on leg movements by applying resistant force at the knee joint. The study showed a significant increase in muscle activity during gait with applied resistance \cite{Washabaugh2016}. Other studies have used assistive robotic devices in gait training. Chisari et al. \cite{Chisari2015} used an assistive robotic device to show significant improvements in hemiparetic patients walking ability, but not in leg muscle strength. Motor imaging training have also been shown to significantly improve on patients gait and leg muscle strength \cite{Kuma2015}. 



%something on that most studies only focus/use treadmill trianing and dont do much in strength training eventhough this is very important. -> this can lead to why we like to do multimodal training which can incorporate both balance AND strength training.

%more on the (hopefully) proven/significant worsening of patient performance in balance/gait/dynamic movement following falls compared to non-fallers. [THIS STUDY IS NOT ON FALLS]

%people get stroke -> stroke lead to bad balance and movement -> people fall -> falls are bad -> current rehab does not make patients not fall -> new rehab -> need new evaluation method -> our project

%it would be nice to put patients through a rehabilitation program which effectively increase their balance and performance of dynamic movements. therefore it is necessary to be able to evaluate if patients get better balance/movement
