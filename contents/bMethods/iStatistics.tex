\section{Statistical Analysis} \label{sec:statistics}

A Kruskal-Wallis test has been implemented for the statistical analysis of the results, as the data comes from non-Gaussian distributed data, and the comparison is between three unmatched groups. The results from the Kruskal-Wallis test were analysed using Bonferroni correction to compensate for the comparison of three groups, and avoid false negatives or positives.
