\section{Data Acquisition}


we record stuff with the shimmers bluetooth directly to matlab and some jacksticks from the FSR's and save force data to an sd card which we put in matlab and organize it all into one matrix where we can do some math on. 

so far there might not be any filtering of any of the data
