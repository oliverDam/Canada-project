\section{Data Acquisition}

During data acquisition the subjects will be wearing the instruments presented earlier in \secref{methods:instrumentation}. The Shimmer3 device will be placed lateral under the knees of the subject.

The FSRs will be placed on the sole of each foot of the subject. One FSR 406 is placed under the heel and two FSR 402 sensors are placed under the front of the foot at the lateral and medial part of the anterior eminence of the sole. The Arduino-setup will be placed at the lower back of the subject and handle data collection. Collected data will be stored on an SD card for later offline analysis with MATLAB. An illustration of device placement on a subject can be seen in \figref{fig:bodySysSetup}.

%% SENSOR BAIT ALERT:
%jeg har skrevet at vi placere en FSR 406 (den store firkant sensor) under hælen. den skal sidde "bag" lilletåen.

Data acquisition from both the FSR sensors and the Shimmer3 devices are set to have a sample frequency of 100Hz. The sample rate is decided to be the same so it is possible to match the two data streams to each other, so it is possible to compare measured pressure forces under the feet while matching it to movement of the body. A simple graphical user interface (GUI) have been developed to match the data. This manual approach is favourable for this project as it were determined that it would be more time consuming to develop an algorithm to automatically match data streams. It would also go beyond the scope for the project.





All data is collected in MATLAB and organized into matrices. then something happens about calculating center of balance and maybe some rotational speed and something. 

Data acquisition from the Shimmer devices are handled by Bluetooth between the Shimmer devices and MATLAB. Sample frequency over 9000. Data is organized into a matrix, because that is the smart thing to do, when doing things in MATLAB.





we record stuff with the shimmers bluetooth directly to matlab and some jacksticks from the FSR's and save force data to an sd card which we put in matlab and organize it all into one matrix where we can do some math on. 

so far there might not be any filtering of any of the data
