\section{Subjects}

For this project two test subjects will be used; one who is a master at Karate, and one who is novice. Both subjects are able-bodied and to the authors best knowledge healthy. Both subjects were prior to the test instructed about the purpose of the study and their role as test subjects. Both the master and novice were instructed to perform the karate kata Pinan Nidan as best they are able to. The novice further received detailed instruction on how to perform the kata, as the novice has never before done karate.
