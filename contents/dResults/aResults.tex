%\section{Results}
%Here results will be presented, with numbers and maybe some graphs or plots of the numbers.


The outcome measures calculated for each subject can be seen in \tabref{tab:measures}.

The final performance score for each subject is presented in \tabref{tab:scores}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|}
		\hline
				          & Novice                     & Intermediate           & Master                   \\  \hline
		Avg. Score & 9.532 $\pm$ 0.292 & 8.579 $\pm$ 0.101 & 7.278 $\pm$ 0.891 \\ \hline

\end{table}

A Kruskal-Wallis test has been implemented for the statistical analysis of the results, as the data comes from non-Gaussian distributed data, and the comparison is between three unmatched groups. The results from the Kruskal-Wallis test was analysed using Bonferroni correction to compensate for the comparison of three groups, and avoid false negatives or positives. The results of the statistical analysis are presented in \tabref{tab:pValues}.

\begin{table}[h]
	\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
		\hline
		& Overall & N vs. I & N vs. M & I vs. M \\ \hline
		Length:    & 0.329   & 0.736   & 0.295   & 0.736   \\ \hline
		Span:      & 0.561   & 0.736   & 0.549   & 0.952   \\ \hline
		Frequency: & 0.177   & 0.896   & 0.372   & 0.173   \\ \hline
		Intensity: & 0.039   & 0.549   & 0.030   & 0.295   \\ \hline
		Score:     & 0.027   & 0.372   & 0.020   & 0.372   \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Statistical analysis p-values for comparison between subjects}

\end{table}

No significant difference was found within either of the length, span or frequency measures. The intensity measure showed a significant difference ($p<0.05$) between the novice ($0.758 \pm 0.013$) and the master ($0.783 \pm 0.003$).

The analysis of the scores showed a significant difference ($p<0.05$) between the novice ($9.532 \pm 0.292$) and the master ($7.278 \pm 0.891$). Otherwise no difference was to be found within the scores.
