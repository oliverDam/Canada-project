abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gait deficits are very common after stroke and improved therapeutic interventions are needed. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the therapeutic use of nociceptive withdrawal reflexes to support gait training in the subacute post-stroke phase.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Individuals were randomly allocated to a treatment group that received physiotherapy-based gait training supported by withdrawal reflex stimulation and a control group that received physiotherapy-based gait training alone. Electrical stimuli delivered to the arch of the foot elicited the withdrawal reflex at heel-off with the purpose of facilitating the initiation and execution of the swing phase. Gait was assessed before and immediately after finishing treatment, and one month and six months after finishing treatment. Assessments included the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC) test, the preferred and maximum gait velocities, the duration of the stance phase in the hemiparetic side, the duration of the gait cycle, and the stance time symmetry ratio.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The treatment group showed an improved post treatment preferred walking velocity (p {\textless} 0.001) and fast walking velocity (p {\textless} 0.001) compared to the control group. Furthermore, subjects in the treatment group with severe walking impairment at inclusion time showed the best improvement as assessed by a longer duration of the stance phase in the hemiparetic side (p {\textless} 0.002) and a shorter duration of the gait cycle (p {\textless} 0.002). The stance time symmetry ratio was significantly better for the treatment than the control group after finishing training (p {\textless} 0.02). No differences between groups were detected with the FAC test after finishing training (p = 0.09).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Withdrawal reflex-based functional electrical therapy was useful in the rehabilitation of the hemiparetic gait of severely impaired patients.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE This systematic review aimed to examine the effects of dual-task balance and mobility training in people with stroke. METHODS An extensive electronic databases literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, PubMed, EBSCO, The Cochrane Library, Web of Science, SCOPUS, and Wiley Online Library. Randomized controlled studies that assessed the effects of dual-task training in stroke patients were included for the review (last search in December 2017). The methodological quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration recommendation, and level of evidence was determined according to the criteria described by the Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine. RESULTS About 13 articles involving 457 participants were included in this systematic review. All had substantial risk of bias and thus provided level IIb evidence only. Dual-task mobility training was found to induce more improvement in single-task walking function (standardized effect size = 0.14-2.24), when compared with single-task mobility training. Its effect on dual-task walking function was not consistent. Cognitive-motor balance training was effective in improving single-task balance function (standardized effect size = 0.27-1.82), but its effect on dual-task balance ability was not studied. The beneficial effect of dual-task training on cognitive function was provided by one study only and thus inconclusive. CONCLUSION There is some evidence that dual-task training can improve single-task walking and balance function in individuals with stroke. However, any firm recommendation cannot be made due to the weak methodology of the studies reviewed.},

abstract = {To assist balance and mobility, older adults are often prescribed walking aids. Nevertheless, surprisingly their use has been associated with increased falls-risk. To address this finding we first need to characterise a person's stability while using a walking aid. Therefore, we present a generalisable method for the assessment of stability of walking frame (WF) users. Our method, for the first time, considers user and device as a combined system. We define the combined centre of pressure (CoPsystem) of user and WF to be the point through which the resultant ground reaction force for all feet of both the WF and user acts if the resultant moment acts only around an axis perpendicular to the ground plane. We also define the combined base of support (BoSsystem) to be the convex polygon formed by the boundaries of the anatomical and WF feet in contact with the ground and interconnecting lines between them. To measure these parameters we have developed an instrumented WF with a load cell in each foot which we use together with pressure-sensing insoles and a camera system, the latter providing the relative position of the WF and anatomical feet. Software uses the resulting data to calculate the stability margin of the combined system, defined as the distance between CoPsystemand the nearest edge of BoSsystem. Our software also calculates the weight supported through the frame and when each foot (of user and/or frame) is on the floor. Finally, we present experimental work demonstrating the value of our approach.},

abstract = {Functional strength training is becoming increasingly popular when rehabilitating individuals with neurological injury such as stroke or cerebral palsy. Typically, resistance during walking is provided using cable robots or weights that are secured to the distal shank of the subject. However, there exists no device that is wearable and capable of providing resistance across the joint, allowing over ground gait training. In this study, we created a lightweight and wearable device using eddy current braking to provide resistance to the knee. We then validated the device by having subjects wear it during a walking task through varying resistance levels. Electromyography and kinematics were collected to assess the biomechanical effects of the device on the wearer. We found that eddy current braking provided resistance levels suitable for functional strength training of leg muscles in a package that is both lightweight and wearable. Applying resistive forces at the knee joint during gait resulted in significant increases in muscle activation of many of the muscles tested. A brief period of training also resulted in significant aftereffects once the resistance was removed. These results support the feasibility of the device for functional strength training during gait. Future research is warranted to test the clinical potential of the device in an injured population.},

abstract = {Wearables such as accelerometers are emerging as powerful tools for quantifying gait in various environments. Flexibility in wearable location may improve ease of use and data acquisition during instrumented testing. However, change of location may impact algorithm functionality when evaluating associated gait characteristics. Furthermore, this may be exacerbated by testing protocol (different walking speed) and age. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the effect of an accelerometer-based wearable(s) (accW) location, walking speed, age and algorithms on gait characteristics. Forty younger (YA) and 40 older adults (OA) were recruited. Participants wore accW positioned at the chest, waist and lower back (L5, gold standard) and were asked to walk continuously for 2 min at preferred and fast speeds. Two algorithms, previously validated for accW located on L5, were used to quantify step time and step length. Mean, variability and asymmetry gait characteristics were estimated for each location with reference to L5. To examine impact of locations and speed on algorithm-dependant characteristic evaluation, adjustments were made to the temporal algorithm. Absolute, relative agreement and difference between measurements at different locations and L5 were assessed. Mean step time and length evaluated from the chest showed excellent agreement compared to L5 for both age groups and speeds. Agreement between waist and L5 was excellent for mean step time for both speeds and age groups, good for mean step length at both speeds for YA and at preferred speed for OA. Step time and length asymmetry evaluated from the chest showed moderate agreement for YA only. Lastly, results showed that algorithm adjustment did not influence agreement between results obtained at different locations. Mean spatiotemporal characteristics can be robustly quantified from accW at the locations used in this study irrespective of speed and age; this is not true when estimating variability and asymmetry characteristics.},

A widely used method to calculate the scatter of center of pressure data is an ellipse that encloses about 100(1. - $\alpha$){\%} of the observations. However, underlying definitions and terminologies have been misused in many cases. Hence, outcomes of different studies are proved to be incommensurable. In order to attain inter-study comparability, standardization of calculation methods has to be advanced. This work features a comprehensive and consistent overview of the methods for elliptic area approximation contrasting general principles of confidence and prediction regions. As a result, we recommend the usage of the prediction ellipse, as far as we demonstrate that confidence ellipses emerge to be inappropriate for posturographic scatter evaluation.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature. Stroke induces bilateral neurological impairment and muscle weakness yielding neurologically more (MA; paretic) and less affected (LA; non-paretic) sides. “Cross-education” refers to training one side of the body to increase strength in the same muscles on the untrained side. Past work showed dorsiflexion training of the LA side produced bilateral strength increases after stroke. The current study explored the presence and extent of cross-education after arm strength training in chronic stroke. Twenty-four chronic stroke participants completed 5 weeks of maximal wrist extension training using their LA arm. Maximal voluntary contraction force, arm motor impairment and functional performance were measured before and after training. Both spinal cord plasticity (n = 12: reciprocal inhibition and cutaneous reflexes, University of Victoria) and cortical plasticity (n = 12: cortical silent period, short-interval intracortical inhibition, intracortical facilitation and transcallosal inhibition, University of British Columbia) were assessed. Five weeks after training, 20 participants completed a follow-up maximal wrist extension retention test. LA wrist extension force increased 42{\%} and MA by 35{\%}. Strength gains were maintained in the follow-up test. Clinically meaningful increases in Fugl-Meyer scores were noted in four participants. Muscle activation was correlated with cutaneous reflex amplitudes after training in the MA arm. LA cortical silent period and transcallosal inhibition from both hemispheres significantly decreased after training. This study shows that high-intensity training with the neurologically less affected “non-paretic” arm can improve strength bilaterally and alter both spinal and cortical plasticity. The extent to which this plasticity can be enhanced or functionally exploited remains to be examined.},

All prospective, controlled clinical trials published in English or Chinese and involving the use of Tai Chi by survivors of stroke were searched in eight electronic databases. Information from the included studies was extracted and synthesized. The methodological quality of all studies was assessed with the Jadad score. Five randomized controlled trials, four in English and one in Chinese, met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. The methodological quality of the trials was moderate (Jadad score, range, 1-4; average score, 2.6). Meta-analysis was not performed because of the heterogeneity of the study conditions and outcome measures. Three studies reported benefits of Tai Chi with respect to improved balance in participants who have had a stroke. Three studies assessed mobility function and reported no improvement after Tai Chi intervention in survivors of stroke. Improvements in quality-of-life and mental health were reported in three trials. This focused review suggests that Tai Chi exercise might be beneficial with respect to balance, quality-of-life, and mental health in survivors of stroke. More rigorous randomized controlled trials are required to determine whether Tai Chi is effective in stroke rehabilitation.},

The aims of this study were (1) to compare motor and cognitive outcomes between individuals who fell in the 6 months' postdischarge from in-patient stroke rehabilitation and those who did not fall, and (2) to explore potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between falls and recovery of motor and cognitive function. Methods Secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study of individuals discharged home from in-patient rehabilitation was conducted. Participants were recruited at discharge and completed a 6-month falls monitoring period using postcards with follow-up. Nonfallers and fallers were compared at the 6-month follow-up assessment on the Berg Balance Scale (BBS), the Chedoke-McMaster Stroke Assessment (CMSA), gait speed, and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Measures of balance confidence and physical activity were also assessed. Results Twenty-three fallers were matched to 23 nonfallers on age and functional balance scores at discharge. A total of 43 falls were reported during the study period (8 participants fell more than once). At follow-up, BBS scores (P =.0066) and CMSA foot scores (P =.0033) were significantly lower for fallers than for nonfallers. The 2 groups did not differ on CMSA leg scores (P =.049), gait speed (P =.47), or MoCA score (P =.23). There was no significant association between change in balance confidence scores and change in physical activity levels among all participants from the first and third questionnaire (r =.27, P =.08). Conclusions Performance in balance and motor recovery of the foot were compromised in fallers when compared to nonfallers at 6 months post discharge from in-patient stroke rehabilitation.},

Objectives: To investigate (1) whether clinical test scores at discharge predict falls or limited community mobility after discharge from inpatient stroke rehabilitation; and (2) how walking and dynamic standing balance change after discharge. Design: Follow-up observational study between 6 and 36 months after discharge. Setting: Rehabilitation setting. Participants: Community-dwelling stroke survivors (N=30) who could walk unassisted when discharged from inpatient rehabilitation. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Six-minute walk test (6MWT), Four Square Step Test (FSST), Step Test (ST), Environmental Analysis of Mobility Questionnaire (EAMQ), Falls Efficacy Scale-International (FES-I), and self-reported falls. Results: Follow-up occurred at a median of 14.5 months postdischarge. Significant improvements occurred between discharge and follow-up for the 6MWT (mean difference [MD]=110.1m; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 70.8-149.4; P{\textless}.001), ST (MD=1.8 steps; 95{\%} CI, 0.3-3.4; P=.03), and FSST (MD=4.3s; 95{\%} CI, -10.3 to 1.6; P=.05). Despite this, 40{\%} of participants reported falling. The group who fell had lower clinical test scores at discharge and follow-up than nonfallers. Specific cutoff scores for the clinical tests accurately classified falls history in 70{\%} to 78{\%} of participants.

abstract = {Miniature sensors that could measure forces applied by the fingers and hand without interfering with manual dexterity or range of motion would have considerable practical value in ergonomics and rehabilitation. In this study, techniques have been developed to use inexpensive pressure-sensing resistors (FSRs) to accurately measure compression force. The FSRs are converted from pressure-sensing to force-sensing devices. The effects of nonlinear response properties and dependence on loading history are compensated by signal conditioning and calibration. A fourth-order polynomial relating the applied force to the current voltage output and a linearly weighted sum of prior outputs corrects for sensor hysteresis and drift. It was found that prolonged ({\textgreater}20 h) shear force loading caused sensor gain to change by approximately 100{\%}. Shear loading also had the effect of eliminating shear force effects on sensor output, albeit only in the direction of shear loading. By applying prolonged shear loading in two orthogonal directions, the sensors were converted into pure compression sensors. Such preloading of the sensor is, therefore, required prior to calibration. The error in compression force after prolonged shear loading and calibration was consistently {\textless}5{\%} from 0 to 30 N and {\textless}10{\%} from 30 to 40 N. This novel method of calibrating FSRs for measuring compression force provides an inexpensive tool for biomedical and industrial design applications where measurements of finger and hand force are needed. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {unemployment. Findings in our study highlight the unique perspectives of Veterans with PTSD within the VHA health care system. Currently, there are limited measures of HRQOL and employment in Veterans with DR-PTSD. Study findings may contribute to the future development of a more sensitive measure of DR-PTSD HRQOL building on the PROMIS/Neu-roQol framework. Objective(s): 50{\%}-65{\%} of stroke survivors have residual motor deficits; principal among them is hemi paretic gait that limits mobility, increases the risk of falls and promoting sedentary life style. Increased strength in the lower extremity muscles has been shown to be associated with im-provements in walking performance. Recently Motor Imagery training (MIT) are enhancing motor learning, neural reorganization and cortical activation in stroke patients. However, efficacy MIT involving lower ex-tremity mobility tasks are limited in stroke rehabilitation. To investigate the effect of combining mental practice with physical practice paretic Lower Extremity Muscles strength and Gait performance in ambulant stroke subjects. Design: Randomized Clinical Trial. Setting: Department of Physical therapy, Tertiary Care Hospitals, Man-galore, India. Participants: 76 hemi paretic patients({\textgreater}3 months post-stroke) who can able to walk 10 m with good imagery ability in KVIQ-20 60 and Time dependent motor imagery screening test were recruited and randomly allocated into physical practice group(nZ38)and physical+ mental practice group(nZ38). Interventions: Subjects in both groups underwent task orientated training for lower extremity 45-60 minutes, 4 days a week for 3 weeks. In addition, the experimental group received 15 minutes of audio-based lower ex-tremity mobility tasks for MI practice. Main Outcome Measure(s): Isometric muscle strength of Hip, Knee and Ankle using a hand-held dynamometer and self-selected 10 m gait speed were assessed before and after 3 weeks. Results: Our results showed significant improvements in the experimental group hip flexors strength 98{\%} compared to 80{\%} in the control group, knee flexors 112{\%} compared to 85{\%} in control group and ankle dorsi-flexors 140{\%} compared to 80{\%} in control group. A significant improve-ment in gait speed was noted in the experimental group (from .52 to .80) compared with the control group (from .56 to .78) with 15{\%} change be-tween them. Conclusions: Additional task specific MI training improves paretic muscle strength and gait performance in ambulant stroke patients.},

abstract = {Objective: To evaluate the effect of Tai Chi on balance and reducing falls incidence in neurological disorders. Data sources: AMED, Embase, Web of Science, SCOPUS, EBSCO and Medline from inception until February 2018. Review method: Randomized controlled trials of Tai Chi compared with active or no treatment control, measuring balance with the Berg Balance Scale or the Timed Up and Go Test and number of falls in neurological disorders were included. Methodological quality was assessed using PEDro and quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Results: A total of 10 studies involving 720 participants were reviewed. Seven studies were in Parkinson's disease and three in stroke. Seven studies were of high methodological quality and three were low. Meta- analyses of balance measured with the Timed Up and Go Test in Parkinson's disease revealed a statistically significant effect of Tai Chi compared to no treatment (weighted mean difference (WMD), –2.13; 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), −3.26 to −1.00; P {\textless} 0.001) and was insignificant (WMD, −0.19; 95{\%} CI, −1.74 to 1.35; P = 0.81) when compared with active treatment. Tai Chi significantly reduced falls incidence in Parkinson's disease (odds ratio (OR), 0.47; 95{\%} CI, 0.29 to 0.77; P = 0.003) and stroke (OR, 0.21; 95{\%} CI, 0.09 to 0.48; P {\textless} 0.001). Balance measured with the Timed Up and Go Test comparing Tai Chi and active treatment was insignificant (WMD, 0.45; 95{\%} CI, –3.43 to 2.54; P = 0.77) in stroke. Conclusion: Tai Chi is effective in reducing falls incidence in Parkinson's disease and stroke. This systematic review did not find high-quality studies among other neurological disorders.},

A treadmill is used which was developed to overcome limitations of regular methods for the analysis of spatio-temporal gait parameters and ground reaction forces during walking and running. The design of the treadmill is based on the use of force transducers underneath a separate left and right plate, which together form the treadmill walking surface. The results of test procedures and measurements show that accurate recordings of vertical ground reaction force can be obtained. These recordings enable a separate analysis of vertical ground reaction forces during double support phases in walking, and the analysis of changes in the centre of pressure (CoP) position during subsequent foot placements. From the CoP data, temporal gait parameters (e.g. duration of left/right support and swing phases) and spatial gait parameters (i.e. left/right step lengths and widths) can be derived. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The evidence supporting their involvement has traditionally been indirect and circumstantial, but recent work has added more solid evidence supporting the role of ubiquitous dimeric calpains in the process of neurodegeneration. The only disease condition in which a calpain defect has been conclusively involved concerns an atypical monomeric calpain: the muscle specific calpain-3, also known as p94. Inactivating defects in its gene cause a muscular dystrophy termed LGMD-2A. The molecular mechanism by which the absence of the proteolytic activity of calpain-3 causes the dystrophic process is unknown. Another atypical calpain, which has been characterized recently as a Ca2(+)-dependent protease, calpain 10, appears To be involved in the etiology of type 2 diabetes. The involvement has been inferred essentially from genetic evidence. Also in the case of type 2 diabetes the molecular mechanisms that could link the disease to calpain 10 are unknown.},

abstract = {Numerous gait event detection (GED) algorithms have been developed using accelerometers as they allow the possibility of long-term gait analysis in everyday life. However, almost all such existing algorithms have been developed and assessed using data collected in controlled indoor experiments with pre-defined paths and walking speeds. On the contrary, human gait is quite dynamic in the real-world, often involving varying gait speeds, changing surfaces and varying surface inclinations. Though portable wearable systems can be used to conduct experiments directly in the real-world, there is a lack of publicly available gait datasets or studies evaluating the performance of existing GED algorithms in various real-world settings. This paper presents a new gait database called MAREA (n = 20 healthy subjects) that consists of walking and running in indoor and outdoor environments with accelerometers positioned on waist, wrist and both ankles. The study also evaluates the performance of six state-of-the-art accelerometer-based GED algorithms in different real-world scenarios, using the MAREA gait database. The results reveal that the performance of these algorithms is inconsistent and varies with changing environments and gait speeds. All algorithms demonstrated good performance for the scenario of steady walking in a controlled indoor environment with a combined median F1score of 0.98 for Heel-Strikes and 0.94 for Toe-Offs. However, they exhibited significantly decreased performance when evaluated in other lesser controlled scenarios such as walking and running in an outdoor street, with a combined median F1score of 0.82 for Heel-Strikes and 0.53 for Toe-Offs. Moreover, all GED algorithms displayed better performance for detecting Heel-Strikes as compared to Toe-Offs, when evaluated in different scenarios.},

Methods A total of 82 cognitively normal elderly participants walked around a 40-m long round walkway twice wearing a TAA at their center of body mass. Gait parameters such as cadence, gait velocity, step time, step length, step time variability, and step time asymmetry were estimated from the low pass-filtered signal of the TAA. The test-retest reliability and concurrent validity with the GAITRite{\textregistered} system were evaluated for the estimated gait parameters.   Results Gait parameters using signals from the vertical axis showed excellent reliability for all gait parameters; the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.79–0.90. A minimum of 26 steps and 14 steps were needed to achieve excellent reliability in step time variability and step time asymmetry, respectively. A strong level of agreement was seen for the basic gait parameters between the TAA and GAITRiteⓇ (ICC = 0.91–0.96).   Conclusions The measurement of gait parameters of elderly individuals with normal cognition using a TAA placed on the body's center of mass was reliable and showed superiority over the GAITRiteⓇ with regard to gait variability and asymmetry. The TAA system was a valid tool for measuring basic gait parameters. Considering its wearability and low price, the TAA system may be a promising alternative to the pressure sensor walkway system for measuring gait parameters.},

Reduced plantarflexion and increased dorsiflexion, compared to control steps, were evoked at the ankle; these kinematic responses were site dependent with minimum responses evoked by stimulation at the heel. The dorsiflexion response was largest when stimulating at toe-off and was larger for stimulation at 15 Hz than at 30 Hz.

METHODS: We studied 9 young (30 +/- 5.2 years), and 6 elderly subjects (68.7 +/- 4.8 years). FPD was measured during normal walking speed using shoe insoles with 99 capacitive sensors. Measured parameters included gait phase characteristics, mean and maximum pressure and force, and relative load.Time-series measurements of each variable for all sensors were grouped into 9 anatomical masks. RESULTS: Elderly subjects had lower normalized maximum pressure for the medial and lateral calcaneal masks, and for all medial masks combined. In the medial calcaneus mask, the elderly group also had a lower absolute maximum and lower mean and normalized mean pressures and forces, compared to young subjects. Elderly subjects had lower maximum force and normalized maximum force and lower mean force and normalized mean forces in the medial masks as well. CONCLUSION: FPD differences between the young and elderly groups were confined to the calcaneus and hallux regions and to the medial side of the foot. In elderly subjects, weight bearing on the lateral side of the foot during heel touch and toe-off phases may affect stability during walking.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the relative sensitivity of center-of- pressure (COP)-based measures to changes in postural steadiness related to age. A variety of time and frequency domain measures of postural steadiness were compared between a group of twenty healthy young adults (21-35 years) and a group of twenty healthy elderly adults (66-70 years) under both eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions. The measures that identified differences between the eyes-open and eyes-closed conditions in the young adult group were different than those that identified differences between the eye conditions in the elderly adult group. Mean velocity of the COP was the only measure that identified age-related changes in both eye conditions, and differences between eye conditions in both age groups. The results of this study will be useful to researchers and clinicians using COP-based measures to evaluate postural steadiness.},

Firstly, an introduction of the key gait parameters and semi-subjective methods is presented. Secondly, technologies and studies on the different objective methods are reviewed. Finally, based on the latest research, the characteristics of each method are discussed. 40{\%} of the reviewed articles published in late 2012 and 2013 were related to non-wearable systems, 37.5{\%} presented inertial sensor-based systems, and the remaining 22.5{\%} corresponded to other wearable systems.

abstract = {The development of interactive rehabilitation technologies which rely on wearable-sensing for upper body rehabilitation is attracting increasing research interest. This paper reviews related research with the aim: 1) To inventory and classify interactive wearable systems for movement and posture monitoring during upper body rehabilitation, regarding the sensing technology, system measurements and feedback conditions; 2) To gauge the wearability of the wearable systems; 3) To inventory the availability of clinical evidence supporting the effectiveness of related technologies. A systematic literature search was conducted in the following search engines: PubMed, ACM, Scopus and IEEE (January 2010–April 2016). Forty-five papers were included and discussed in a new cuboid taxonomy which consists of 3 dimensions: sensing technology, feedback modalities and system measurements. Wearable sensor systems were developed for persons in: 1) Neuro-rehabilitation: stroke (n = 21), spinal cord injury (n = 1), cerebral palsy (n = 2), Alzheimer (n = 1); 2) Musculoskeletal impairment: ligament rehabilitation (n = 1), arthritis (n = 1), frozen shoulder (n = 1), bones trauma (n = 1); 3) Others: chronic pulmonary obstructive disease (n = 1), chronic pain rehabilitation (n = 1) and other general rehabilitation (n = 14). Accelerometers and inertial measurement units (IMU) are the most frequently used technologies (84{\%} of the papers). They are mostly used in multiple sensor configurations to measure upper limb kinematics and/or trunk posture. Sensors are placed mostly on the trunk, upper arm, the forearm, the wrist, and the finger. Typically sensors are attachable rather than embedded in wearable devices and garments; although studies that embed and integrate sensors are increasing in the last 4 years. 16 studies applied knowledge of result (KR) feedback, 14 studies applied knowledge of performance (KP) feedback and 15 studies applied both in various modalities. 16 studies have conducted their evaluation with patients and reported usability tests, while only three of them conducted clinical trials including one randomized clinical trial. This review has shown that wearable systems are used mostly for the monitoring and provision of feedback on posture and upper extremity movements in stroke rehabilitation. The results indicated that accelerometers and IMUs are the most frequently used sensors, in most cases attached to the body through ad hoc contraptions for the purpose of improving range of motion and movement performance during upper body rehabilitation. Systems featuring sensors embedded in wearable appliances or garments are only beginning to emerge. Similarly, clinical evaluations are scarce and are further needed to provide evidence on effectiveness and pave the path towards implementation in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Objectives: To determine ambulatory activity in a sample of community-dwelling people with chronic hemiparetic stroke and to examine whether deficits in balance and gait and cardiovascular and metabolic fitness are key determinants of ambulatory activity levels. Design: Descriptive correlational. Setting: Home and community. Participants: Twenty-eight men and 22 women (N=50) over the age 45 years with more than 6 months of hemiparetic gait after ischemic stroke. Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Ambulatory activity (total daily step activity), mobility deficit severity (Berg Balance Scale [BBS] scores, timed 10-m walks), and cardiovascular fitness (energy costs of hemiparetic gait, peak exercise capacity [Vo2peak]). Results: Mean ambulatory activity profiles were extremely low (2837 steps/d vs reported 5000-6000 steps/d in sedentary older adults). Ambulatory activity levels were strongly associated with BBS scores (r=.581, P{\textless}.001) and self-selected floor walking velocity (r=.554, P{\textless}.001). Participants also had profound cardiovascular deconditioning (mean Vo2peak, 11.7±2. 8mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1). The energy costs of hemiparetic gait were high (8.7±1.7mL{\textperiodcentered}kg-1{\textperiodcentered}min-1), representing 76{\%} of physiologic fitness reserve. Although the relationships of economy of gait and Vo2peak to ambulatory activity was not statistically significant, both the Vo2peak and the physiologic fitness reserve, as expressed by fractional utilization, were strongly related to balance (r=.374, P=.02; r=-.430, P{\textless} .01, respectively.) The BBS predicted 30{\%} of the variance in ambulatory activity. Conclusions: Ambulatory activity levels and cardiovascular fitness in patients with chronic stroke are extremely low. Mobility deficits, particularly in balance, are associated with low ambulatory activity. Balance-related inactivity may be an important factor in deconditioning. Further studies are needed to better understand whether task-oriented exercise enhances balance and whether increases in daily ambulatory activity yield improved cardiovascular fitness in chronic stroke survivors. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

abstract = {Postural control is a complex skill based on the interaction of dynamic sensorimotor processes, and can be challenging for people with deficits in sensory functions. The foot plantar center of pressure (COP) has often been used for quantitative assessment of postural control. Previously, the foot plantar COP was mainly measured by force plates or complicated and expensive insole-based measurement systems. Although some low-cost instrumented insoles have been developed, their ability to accurately estimate the foot plantar COP trajectory was not robust. In this study, a novel individual-specific nonlinear model was proposed to estimate the foot plantar COP trajectories with an instrumented insole based on low-cost force sensitive resistors (FSRs). The model coefficients were determined by a least square error approximation algorithm. Model validation was carried out by comparing the estimated COP data with the reference data in a variety of postural control assessment tasks. We also compared our data with the COP trajectories estimated by the previously well accepted weighted mean approach. Comparing with the reference measurements, the average root mean square errors of the COP trajectories of both feet were 2.23 mm (±0.64) (left foot) and 2.72 mm (±0.83) (right foot) along the medial–lateral direction, and 9.17 mm (±1.98) (left foot) and 11.19 mm (±2.98) (right foot) along the anterior–posterior direction. The results are superior to those reported in previous relevant studies, and demonstrate that our proposed approach can be used for accurate foot plantar COP trajectory estimation. This study could provide an inexpensive solution to fall risk assessment in home settings or community healthcare center for the elderly. It has the potential to help prevent future falls in the elderly.},

abstract = {Robot-mediated post-stroke therapy for the upper-extremity dates back to the 1990s. Since then, a number of robotic devices have become commercially available. There is clear evidence that robotic interventions improve upper limb motor scores and strength, but these improvements are often not transferred to performance of activities of daily living. We wish to better understand why. Our systematic review of 74 papers focuses on the targeted stage of recovery, the part of the limb trained, the different modalities used, and the effectiveness of each. The review shows that most of the studies so far focus on training of the proximal arm for chronic stroke patients. About the training modalities, studies typically refer to active, active-assisted and passive interaction. Robot-therapy in active assisted mode was associated with consistent improvements in arm function. More specifically, the use of HRI features stressing active contribution by the patient, such as EMG-modulated forces or a pushing force in combination with spring-damper guidance, may be beneficial.Our work also highlights that current literature frequently lacks information regarding the mechanism about the physical human-robot interaction (HRI). It is often unclear how the different modalities are implemented by different research groups (using different robots and platforms). In order to have a better and more reliable evidence of usefulness for these technologies, it is recommended that the HRI is better described and documented so that work of various teams can be considered in the same group and categories, allowing to infer for more suitable approaches. We propose a framework for categorisation of HRI modalities and features that will allow comparing their therapeutic benefits.$\backslash$nPMID: 25012864},

Eleven sub-acute stroke patients with varying degrees of upper limb function were recruited. Each subject participated in a control session (repeated twice) and a feedback session (repeated twice). In each session, the subjects were presented with a rectangular pattern displayed on a vertical mounted monitor embedded in the table in front of the patient. The subjects were asked to move a marker inside the rectangular pattern by using their most affected hand. During the feedback session, the thickness of the rectangular pattern was changed according to the performance of the subject, and the color of the marker changed according to its position, thereby guiding the subject's movements. In the control session, the thickness of the rectangular pattern and the color of the marker did not change. The results showed that the movement similarity and smoothness was higher in the feedback session than in the control session while the duration of the movement was longer.

A Bland-Altman assessment for agreement was used to compare equilibrium scores produced by the NeuroCom and iPad2 devices. Limits of agreement was defined as the mean bias (NeuroCom - iPad) ± 2 standard deviations. Mean absolute percentage error and median difference between the NeuroCom and iPad2 measurements were used to evaluate how closely the real-time COG sway measured by the 2 systems tracked each other.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The limits between the 2 devices ranged from -0.5° to 0.5° in SOT condition 1 to -2.9° to 1.3° in SOT condition 5. The largest absolute value of the measurement error within the 95{\%} confidence intervals for all conditions was 2.9°.
